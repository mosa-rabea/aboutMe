why i love the cat ???
They are beautiful, purring, intelligent pets that love and entertain us every day. Even the biggest cynics can't resist smiling when a playful cat chases a laser toy or frolics in catnip. We love our cats and, unlike dogs, cats are low maintenance. They don't require a lot of space and they are cheap to feed</p>

Anime is just the perfect thing for those, who are fascinated with animation which narrate amazing storylines. The visuals leave an impact hard enough to make you re-watch it. Anime is like a dreamland, carrying great stories with a rainbow of emotions</p>
